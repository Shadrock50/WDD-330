    <h2>Week02</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Week 2 notes/exercises</h2> <p>Most of this is review. I don't expect problems.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Reading 1: Chapter 2</h2> <p>All of this is review. Sections on scope were important to review. <br>Scoping with javascript works different from c#</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Reading 1: Chapter 3</h2> <p>Focused on studying for arrays. Array looping is weird in Js. Got a decent handle on it. Just need to remember array.push instead of .add</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Reading 1: Chapter 4</h2> <p>I can't really understand the purpose of callbacks. I understand how they work, I just don't know when you'd use them over a full function.</p>
