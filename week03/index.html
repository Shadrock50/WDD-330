    <h2>Week03</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Week 3 notes/exercises</h2> <p>Most of this is review. I don't expect problems.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Reading 1: This Javascript</h2> <p>This.function() is just different enough for me to pay very close attention to it. I spent a lot of time reviewing it.<br>Scoping with javascript works different from c#</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Reading 2: Chapter 5</h2> <p>Objects are actually more handy in this than much else, given that all other types are objects. Using dot notation and bracket notation is interesting that they have both.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Reading 3: Chapter 6</h2> <p>DOM notation has always been a struggle for me, even after years of working with it. Thinking of it like an object helps. I still will probably have to locate a tutorial every time.</p>
