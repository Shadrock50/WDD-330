        <h2>Reading 1: Chapter 8</h2> <p>Forms are pretty standard review. I didn't know that forms could be accessed by an index. Cool. I assume all of this is for database pulling or CRUD functions.
            Interesting to know that onchange triggers before blur. When would you use the submit event rather than onSubmit from an html. If you can use blur to clear default text, why not just do default text in html? Isn't this over complicating things?
            Form elements are review.

        <h2>Reading 2: Chapter 12</h2> <p>OOP is mostly review. Almost all programming is OOP. Constructor syntax is very different. Need to remember function(element=elementValue){}. Not needing parenthesis is going ot confuse me. Static values are like private values in C. I'm not sure why you would create a prototype instead of just hard coding a default.
            I've never truly understood why to use factories. I would love a good example of when you use it.

        <h2>Reading 3: Chapter 15</h2> <p>I struggle with coupling. Modules have their own scope. Exports and imports are important. </p>
